Merely a memory\r\nI intervene 'cause I tend to be a lil' more optimistic than the wildest child or the most imaginative\r\nI sip the tea after my opinion\r\nThey Pistol Pete, dishin' out assistance, government aid\r\nWhat does it take to break the mold, ayy, I hate the po' like the base is low\r\nBut I'm out the park like the acre gone\r\nSaba with the sabre sword\r\nFocusin' on what we can't afford, in the scheme of things, guess it just ain't important\r\nWho wasn't broke for a moment or three\r\nStart stainin' like, \"Oh, it was free,\" then stop for a moment of peace\r\nAnd plus they would call the police if you kept showin' ya face\r\nI said I stopped dreamin', instead I decided to chase\r\nAnd I ain't look back, that's how you turn to stone\r\nMy first friend up in high school was a Stone\r\nHe said come and join, I ain't come along\r\nNot cause I'm high and mighty, just I knew right from wrong\r\nSomewhere I belong, looked, but I didn't find\r\nBut instead of getting discouraged, I got my city behind\r\nNow I'm feelin' worldwide, next stop NY\r\nNext month L.A., then back West Side\r\nYou change when a friend dies, new man since I lost Kobe\r\nHe got out of prison then called my phone like, \"Where COMFORTZone?\"\r\nAnd since then I lost touch, but this year I'm gettin' it back\r\nI finally feel like myself, what I've been on, don't even ask\r\nThey ask me, \"Why the Bucket List?\"\r\nYou know the bucket list, I finally climbed the rock\r\nMade it to the top of the precipice\r\nI came from the pessimism of inner city as it is\r\nAccident prone youth, adult say, \"Don't take a chance\"\r\nBut we never listen, we went and did it, they vision impaired\r\nSo what do you fear, and why are you scared?\r\nWhy are you scared? Why are you scared?\r\n\r\n[Chorus: Saba & Ravyn Lenae]\r\nSee the horizon from the road, and hope that we drove\r\nThe right direction\r\n'Cause I don't wanna slow\r\nDown for no gas\r\nAnd plus I'm runnin' low on cash\r\nBut I know that my bucket gon' make it to California, California\r\nSee the horizon from the road, and hope that we drove\r\nThe right direction\r\n'Cause I don't wanna slow\r\nDown for no gas\r\nAnd plus I'm runnin' low on cash\r\nBut I know that my bucket gon' make it to California, California\r\nHmmm-mm-mm, Cali, Cali\r\nSee the horizon from the road, and hope that we drove (Drove)\r\nThe right direction\r\n'Cause I don't wanna slow (Slow)\r\nDown for no gas\r\nAnd plus I'm runnin' low on cash (Cash)\r\nBut I know that my bucket gon' make it to California, California\r\n\r\n[Interlude: Lupe Fiasco]\r\nYo yo yo what up? This is Lupe Fiasco\r\nAnd my bucket list...has many things in it\r\nOne of 'em is uh, wantin' to win the Nobel Prize, for somethin'. Uhhhh, I also want...yeah that's it, I just wanna win the Nobel Prize\r\nYeah!\r\n\r\n[Bridge: Saba]\r\nHouse, in a gated neighborhood, not the hood, in the hills\r\nPlus an ocean view, your wife and you is good\r\nAnd your bills, ain't never stress you and you get karate lesson\r\nHere's to no more tears\r\n\r\n[Refrain: Saba]\r\nLook at what you done started?\r\nLook at what you done started?\r\nLookin' at how you've gone, gone\r\nDo you want a shooting star?\r\nLook at what you done started?\r\nLook at what you done started?\r\nLookin' at how you've gone, gone\r\nYou can leave it runnin'\r\n\r\n[Outro: Donterio Hundon]\r\nYo yo yo, shoutout to my boy Saba, man. It's ya boy Donterio Hundon, man. Ya know I fuck with ya bro, but I gotta bake anotha one, on baby. Boy, yo' ass look like a deep-fried West African squirrel with kinky twists, yo' lil' ugly ass boy.

Yo' ass look like a- yo' ass look like a cool chimpanzee with a mop in it's head, yo' lil' ugly ass boy, and we heard what happened to you, mhm. You thought we wasn't gonna find out, we found out, boy. Yo' ass was performing Sugar Pie Honey Bun every Tuesday on karaoke night at TGI Fridays. You got kicked off stage 'cause they ain't pay you enough, Corona top, and they didn't give you no free Heineken, yo' lil' ugly ass boy. Yo' ass look like the unpaid Future with no future, yo' lil' ugly ass boy. On my mom, yo' ass smell like a bag of whoop-dat-ass and train smoke, yo' lil' ugly ass boy, on baby. You look like the type of nigga that be gettin'- orderin' nachos with no cheese on them bitch. You look like the nigga to get on the CTA bus and put 200 pennies in that bitch, yo' lil' ugly ass boy, on baby, you bogus",

Everybody's jokin' now\r\nThe clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow\r\nSnap back to reality, ope, there goes gravity\r\nOpe, there goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad\r\nBut he won't give up that easy, no, he won't have it\r\nHe knows his whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter\r\nHe's dope, he knows that, but he's broke, he's so stagnant\r\nHe knows when he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's\r\nBack to the lab again, yo, this old rhapsody\r\nBetter go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou better lose yourself in the music\r\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\r\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\r\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\r\nYou better lose yourself in the music\r\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\r\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\r\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\r\nYou better\r\n\r\n[Verse 2]\r\nHis soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping\r\nThis world is mine for the taking, make me king\r\nAs we move toward a new world order\r\nA normal life is boring, but superstardom's\r\nClose to post-mortem, it only grows harder\r\nHomie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over\r\nThese hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows\r\nHe's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads\r\nGod only knows he's grown farther from home, he's no father\r\nHe goes home and barely knows his own daughter\r\nBut hold your nose 'cause here goes the cold water\r\nThese hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product\r\nThey moved on to the next schmoe who flows\r\nHe nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera\r\nIs told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner\r\nBut the beat goes on, da-da-dom, da-dom, dah-dah-dah-dah\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou better lose yourself in the music\r\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\r\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\r\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\r\nYou better lose yourself in the music\r\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\r\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\r\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\r\nYou better\r\n\r\n[Verse 3]\r\nNo more games, I'ma change what you call rage\r\nTear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged\r\nI was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed\r\nI've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage\r\nBut I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher\r\nBest believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper\r\nAll the pain inside amplified by the\r\nFact that I can't get by with my nine-to-\r\nFive and I can't provide the right type of life for my family\r\n'Cause, man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers\r\nAnd there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life\r\nAnd these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder\r\nTryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter\r\nCaught up between bein' a father and a prima donna\r\nBaby-mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna\r\nStay in one spot, another day of monotony's gotten me\r\nTo the point I'm like a snail, I've got\r\nTo formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot\r\nSuccess is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not\r\nMom, I love you, but this trailer's got\r\nTo go, I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot\r\nSo here I go, it's my shot; feet, fail me not\r\nThis may be the only opportunity that I got\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nYou better lose yourself in the music\r\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\r\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\r\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\r\nYou better lose yourself in the music\r\nThe moment, you own it, you better never let it go (Go)\r\nYou only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow\r\nThis opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo\r\nYou better\r\n\r\n[Outro]\r\nYou can do anything you set your mind to, man",

Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it\r\nWe're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls\r\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls\r\nLookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you\r\nDaddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news\r\nI try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems\r\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\r\nAll the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see\r\nDaddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did\r\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\r\nBut things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'\r\nTogether ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers\r\nBut then, of course, everything always happens for a reason\r\nI guess it was never meant to be\r\nBut it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is\r\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\r\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\r\nEverything's gonna be alright\r\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\r\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\r\nI know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\r\nWe feel how we feel inside\r\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\r\nBut I promise Mama's gon' be alright\r\n\r\n[Verse 2]\r\nHeh, it's funny\r\nI remember back one year when Daddy had no money\r\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree\r\nAnd said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em\r\nI'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying\r\n'Cause Daddy felt like a bum\u2014see, Daddy had a job\r\nBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom\r\nAnd at the time, every house that we lived in\r\nEither kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block\r\nAnd your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar\r\nTryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\r\nAlmost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it\r\nAnd I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart\r\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart\r\nMom and Dad was arguin' a lot\r\nSo Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment\r\nAnd Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\r\nAnd that's when Daddy went to California with his CD\r\nAnd met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me\r\nBut Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me\r\nThen you started seein' Daddy on the TV\r\nAnd Mama didn't like it\r\nAnd you and Lainie were too young to understand it\r\nPapa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit\r\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\r\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand\r\n'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\r\nNow I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'\r\nLookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\r\nTo see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now\r\nWow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here\r\nLainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here\r\nI like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?\r\nShh! Mama's only gone for the moment\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\r\nEverything's gonna be alright\r\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\r\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\r\nI know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\r\nWe feel how we feel inside\r\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\r\nBut I promise Mama's gon' be alright\r\n\r\n[Outro]\r\nAnd if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\r\nI'ma give you the world\r\nI'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you\r\nI'll do anything for you to see you smile\r\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\r\nI'ma break that birdie's neck\r\nI'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\r\nAnd make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!
