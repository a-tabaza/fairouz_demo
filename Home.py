        In the field of Information Retrieval and Natural Language Processing, text embeddings play a significant role in tasks such as classification, clustering, and topic modeling. However, extending these embeddings to abstract concepts such as music, which involves multiple modalities, presents a unique challenge. Our work addresses this challenge by integrating rich multi-modal data into a unified joint embedding space. This space includes textual, visual, acoustic, and graph-based modality features. By doing so, we mirror cognitive processes associated with music interaction and overcome the disjoint nature of individual modalities. The resulting joint low-dimensional vector space facilitates retrieval, clustering, embedding space arithmetic, and cross-modal retrieval tasks. Importantly, our approach carries implications for music information retrieval and recommendation systems. Furthermore, we propose a novel multi-modal model that integrates various data typesâ€”text, images, graphs, and audioâ€”for music representation learning. Our model aims to capture the complex relationships between different modalities, enhancing the overall understanding of music. By combining textual descriptions, visual imagery, graph-based structures, and audio signals, we create a comprehensive representation that can be leveraged for a wide range of music-related tasks. Notably, our model demonstrates promising results in music classification and recommendation systems.
